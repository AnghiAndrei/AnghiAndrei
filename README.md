## Who I am
![mia foto](io.webp)
Hello, I'm Andrei Anghi, a full-stack programmer specializing in web development.
I am highly motivated, with a strong problem-solving attitude and always seeking new challenges.
Thanks to my experience, I can handle any project independently, respecting the requirements and deadlines.
Moreover, I am recognized as an excellent collaborator, appreciated for my ability to work in a team.
Currently, I am 20 years old.
I speak Italian fluently and have a good command of English and Romanian. My journey into the world of computing began on October 26, 2019, experimenting with Batch. I started sharing the world of computing on social media on September 7, 2022.
I obtained my diploma from IIS Ulderico Midossi in the ITT computer science program with a score of 80 out of 100. Currently, I am pursuing my studies at the University 42 Roma Lius.
My goal: Code a better future.
